To a sociologist, kissing and many other common behaviors are cultural rather than natural.
These shared values of a society form the basis of norms, which are a set of social rules that most people in the society follow.
If we violate, or go against, social norms, there will probably be negative consequences.
That is, there may be a penalty or punishment to discourage us frome acting this way again.
These are sometimes called folkways.
Folkways are customs that members of a group are expected to follow to show courtesy to others.
For example, saying "excuse me" when you burp is an American folkway.
Mores are much stronger social norms.
In modern societies, most mores are formalized as laws.
The government enforces laws.
As a result, some norms and their underlying values may be considered important in one society but not in another.
In China, however, the same praise would receive a humbler response such as, "Oh, no, I have done poorly."
This is because humility ranks high in the Chinese value system.
However, norms for behavior sometimes persist even after their underlying values have changed.
Rice is a symbol of fertility, a quality that was highly valued by society in the past.
During adolescence, people become increasingly involved with their peer group, a group whose members are about the same age and have similar interests.
The peer group - along with the family and the school - is one of the three main agents of socialization.
Whereas parents and teachers have more power than children and students, the peer group is made up of equals.
Most teenagers, though, rebel only by making fun of older people in a harmless way.
These traits are typical of adolescents in modern,
Peer groups often develop subcultures with their own distinct values, language, music, dress, and heroes.
Members of these groups often believe in the same things, talk the same way, dress the same way, listen to the same music, and like and dislike the same celebrities.
They are inclined to seek advice from parents on financial, educational, career, and other serious matters.
Second, strong peer group conformity may result in ingroups and outgroups.
These groups are sometimes called cliques.
Bullying may be continuous teasing, but it may become more serious and include harassment and physical abuse as well.
Actions by crowds are one example of what sociologists call collective behavior.
Collective behavior is social behavior that is relatively unorganized, spontaneous, and unpredictable.
It contrasts with institutional behavior, which occurs in a well-organized, rather predictable way.
Collective behavior in a crowd can be categorized according to protest a government action may express their anger.
A hostile crowd may turn violent, throwing rocks and breaking windows.
In 1990 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, thousands of Muslim pilgrims were walking through a very long tunnel when the lights accidentally went out.
The people were frightened and started a stampede.
One theory to explain why crowds seem to act collectively is Gustave Le Bon's social contagion theory.
Le Bon believe that the large number of people in a crowd allows our primitive side to emerge.
In a crowd we are faceless and nameless and this allows us to act in an emotional and irrational way.
A different perspective is found in the emergent-norm theory.
Hooliganism is a form of collective behavior that sometimes occurs at or after sports events.
It includes destructive and often violent activities by fans of opposing teams.
In 1985, at the European Cup final in Brussels, 39 people died when Belgian and English soccer fans rioted and a wall in the stadium collapsed on them.
Giels are cuddled and kissed while boys are more frequently bounced around and lifted high in the air.
By age four, girls and boys have learned to imitate these conversational styles.
As a result, boys may grow up with a fear of being feminine and, as young men, try to keep up a macho, that is, very masculine, image.
Boys' friendships are often based on physical ability and dominant behavior.
They have more intense friendships, based on emotional connections and shared secrets.
Increasingly today, many parents try to bring up their children in a gender-neutral way.
This gender bias may have been unintentional, but 30 years of research showed that it occurred in almost all education settings.
Studies show that at age nine, the majority of girls are confident, assertive and positive about themselves.
However, when they reach high school their self-esteem and their performances in math and science decrease.
The mass media is another very important agent of socialization.
Television commercials, for example, have until recently presented women primarily as sex object or as dutiful homemakers.
Many movies use younger, thinner women as "body-doubles" for close-ups of female movie stars.
Body image is how people perceive their own bodies.
Stereotypes of women have also appeared on many television programs in the past.
These kinds of roles can still be seen today, for example, in many of the telenovelas from Latin America.
Many male characters are portrayed as capable, strong, and ready to fight to defend themselves or to protect others.
Perhaps the best example is in Japanese manga, in which males are usually dominant and females are generally dependent and submissive.
Because gender is one basis for social inequality, that is, privileges and access for some groups but not for others, it is especially important to understand these messages about gender and gender roles.
Today, the Internet is so integrated into our lives and the media that it is hard to imagine a world without it.
This is possible because of two important developments in digital technology: the browser and the search engine.
Anyone can find large amounts of news and information instantly.
Users no longer have to depend on what they a newspaper or television station decides is newsworthy.
They can also find entertainment that is not available on traditional media, such as interactive games.
The telephone directory usually just provides the name, address, and telephone number of a business.
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is created by users.
Although the Internet has brought many advances, the speed and accessibility of the medium also has drawbacks.
The term digital divide refers to unequal access to digital information.
Social media have spread quickly and are now pervasive.
The survey also showed that in the preceding year,
Facebook even has its own currency so users can buy and sell things within the site.
How have social media affected interpersonal interaction?
Some people worry that social media users spend too much time in cyberspace, and the will become isolated from real life and real people.
Another concern is that the Internet and social sites like Facebook make it possible to interact anonymously.
There have been several shocking cases of cyberbullying, in which some users have harassed another user anonymously.
Cyberbullying includes sending hostile messages, spreading rumors, and publishing personal information or embarrassing photographs.
A few have committed suicide as a result.
Social movements are a form of collective behavior to promote or prevent social or political change.
Others, such as the civil rights movement in the United States, are considered reform movements.
Social media have provided these movements with an accessible and efficient way to communicate with other members of the movement and publicize their efforts outside of the movement.
President Barack Obama used social media extensively in his 2008 presidential campaign, but the impact of social media on politics is not limited to the United States.
The 2011 political unrest spread through the use of YouTube and Facebook.
New media may offer advantages for education, but some people are concerned that technology can also be a distraction and may even get in the way of learning.
In the past, students had to learn and remember a lot of things - names of important people, lines of poems, mathematical equations.
In a way, the Internet has become our collective memory.
A 2010 study in England revealed that the average Briton spends seven hours a day using some form of media.
Opponents have a different perspective.
They believe that the wide range and complexity of information makes us smarter, not dumber.
 then, the members of that society need to behave in orderly ways:
 These are referred to as internal controls and external controls.
 Internal controls are the controls that you impose on yourself based on your values, beliefs, and fears.
 The second aspect of internal control is the possible disapproval of friends and family who might find out about your shoplifting.
 The third factor that may deter you from stealing is the fear of detection and its consequences.
 Many shops display signs that say shoplifters will be reported and prosecuted.
 Some stores also employ detectives to discourage shoppers from stealing and to identify those who do steal.
 In a studyof property crime arrests, researchers compared the percentage of arrests in two populations
 ONe theory in sociology states that out internal controls develop out of the social bonds, such as employment, friendships, and family that connect people in a community.
 Deviance tends to occur when these social bonds are weak.
 For these people, the imposition of external controls, such as polocing and punishment, may discourage them from committing crimes.
 Some controls, such as policing and closed circuit cameras, are preventive.
 Other external controls are punishments for deviant behacior.
 There are three main kinds of these punitive external cntrols.
 Finally, the most severe is imprisonment, and in some societies, physical punishment or even death.
 If you were driving while drunk, you could also lose your driver's license, or you mught even have to serve time in prison.
 There are a number of factors in the effectiveness of these external controls in stopping people from committing crimes.
 Their effectiveness depends, in part, on the certainty of punishment.
 If there is little likelihood of being caught, the external contrils may not be very effective deterrents.
 For example, people who commit "crimes of passion" feel uncontrillable rage of overwhelming emotional pressure.
 Law enforcement agencies: government offices that are responsible for upholding laws and finding people who break them.
 It is a challenging job, but in recent history, forensics - the use of science and technology to solve crimes - has become an important tool.
 A person's fingerprints are the swirled patterns on the skin at the tips of the fingers.
 Sometime it is only a partial fingerprint, but that can be sufficient to make an identification.
 Many fingerprints are invisible under normal circumstances, but they can be made visible with special chemicals.
 Peints can also be examined in darkness using highpowered lasers, anf they can be retrieved from almost any surface - even clothing, plastic bags, or human skin.
 These have been computerized to make it easier to search for matching prints.
 Handwriting analysis has been used to identify a wide range of offenders, from serial killers to war criminals.
 Bloodstains are also important clues in violent crimes.
 Criminals sometimes try to wash blood away, but forensic professionals can detect blood even if the ratio of blood to water is 1:12,000.
 If detecitve know where the insects come from, they can trace the drug back to a particular location in the world.
 DNA analysis is based on the fact that every person (except an identical twin) has unique DNA.
 A sample of DNA can be raken from a person and matched to a sample of DNA taken from a crime scene - from a drop of blood, saliva, or perhaps a strand of hair.
 If there is no match to DNA from the crime scene, suspects can be eliminated.
 lenses, butt, inside flap, mouthpiece, scrapings.
 When a crime does occur, law enforcement - detection and prosecution of the crime - begins.
 Prisons serve a variety of purposes.
 This is called the deterrence function.
 Imprisonment, as well as other forms of punishment, also satisfies the public's desire for a criminal to be punished.
 This is called the retribution function.
 Most criminals cannot commit additional crimes while they are in prison; this is the incapacitation function.
 Finally, modern prison programs often try to help criminals change their behaviors so they can reenter society.
 This is called the rehabilitation function.
 Most experts agree that imprisonment, or incarceration, successfully fulfills some of its function some of the time.
 Prison provides a controlled and predictable environment where inmates are clothed, fed, and told what to do.
 Rehabilitation programs may include drug treatment, job training, counseling, and education.
 It may also include resocialization, that is, training for how to behave appropriately out side of prison.
 By their very nature, prisons work against rehabilitation.
 For example, instead of going to jail, some offenders are put on probation.
 This means that they are allowed to remain in the community under some kind of supervision.
 New technologies, including security bracelets, can assist in this supervision.
 The ultimate punishment is the death penalty, which is also called capital punishment.
 Many countries have abolished the death penalty.
 However, according to Amnesty International, in 2009, capital punishment was still in active use in 58 countries.
 In most countries, it has been used as a punishment for homicide, but some governments have also used it against political enemies.
 It's human noise and clamor.
 That, coupled with the sight of those dreary bars, made me think,'Man, what have I gotten myself into here?!'
 Prison is a confined place, packed with living bodies of every shape, color, and size.
