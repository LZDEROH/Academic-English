To a sociologist, kissing and many other common behaviors are cultural rather than natural.
These aharred values of a society form the basis of norms, which are a set of social rules that most people in the society follow.
If we violate, or gao against, social norms, there will probably be negative consequences.
That is, there may be a penalty or punishment to discourage us frome acting this way again.
These are sometimes called folkways.
Folkways are customs that members of a group are expecte to follow to show courtesy to others.
For example, saying"excuse me" when you burp is an American folkway.
Mores are much stronger social norms.
In mordern socirties, most mores are formalized as laws.
The fovernment enforces laws.
As a result, some norms and their underlying values may be considered importantin one society but not in another.
In China, however, the some praise would receive a humbler response such as, "Oh, no, I have done poorly."
This is because humility ranks high in the Chinese value system.
However, norms for behivior sometimes persist even after their unferlying values have changed.
Rice is a symbol of fertility, a quality that was highly valued by society in the past.
During adolescence, people become increasingly invloved with their peer group, a group whose members are about the some age and have similar interests.
The peer group - along with the family and the school - is one of the three main agents of socialization.
Whereas parents and teachers have more power than children and students, the peer group is made up of equals.
Most teenagers, though, rebel only by making fun of older people in a harmless way.
These traits are typical of adolescents in modern,
Peer groups often develop subcultures with their own distinct values, language, music, dress, and heroes.
Members of these groups often believe i the same things, talk the same way, dress the same way, listen to the same musci, and like and dislike the same celebrities.
They are inclined to seek advice from parents on financial, educational, career, and other serious matters.
Second, strong peer group conformity may result in ingroups and outgroups.
These groups are sometimes called cliques.
Bullying may be continuous teasing, but it may become more serious and include harassment and physical abuse as well.
Actions by crowds are one example of what socioligists call collective behavior.
Collective behavior is social behavior that is relatively unorganized, spontaneous, and unpredictable.
It contrasts with institutional behavior, which occurs in a well-organized, rather predictable way.
Collective behvior in a crowd can be categorized according to protest a government action may express their anger.
A hostile crowd may turn violent, throwing rocks and breaking windows.
In 1990 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, thousads of Muslim pilgrims were walking through a very long tunnel when the lights accidentally went out.
The people were frighetened and started a stampede.
One theory to explain why crowds seem to act collectively is Gustace Le Bon's social contagion theory.
Le Bon believe that the large number of people in a crowd allows our primitive side to emerge.
In a crowd we are faceless and nameless and this allows us to act in an emotional and irrational way.
A different perspective is found in the emergent-norm theory.
Hooliganism is a form of collective behavior that sometimes occurs at or after sports events.
It includes destructive and often ciolent activities by fans of opposing teams.
In 1985, at the European Cup final in Brussels, 39 people died when Belgian and English soccer fans rioted and a wall in the stadium collapsed on them.
Giels are cuddled and kissed while boys are more frequently bounced around and lifted high in the air.
By age four, girls and boys have learned to imitate these conversational styles.
As a result, boys may grow up with a fear of being feminine and, as young men, try to keep up a macho, that is, very masculine, image.
Boys' friendships are often based on physical ability and dominant behavior.
They have more intense friendships, based on emotional connections and shared secrets.
Increasingly today, many parents try to bring up their children in a gender-neutral way.
This gender bias may have been unintentional, but 30 years of research showed that it occurred in almost all education settings.
Studies show that at age nine, the majority of girls are confident, assertive and positive about themselves.
However, when they reach high school their self-esteem and their performances in math and science decrease.
The mass media is another very important agent of socialization.
Television commercials, for example, have until recently presented women primarily as sex object or as dutiful homemakers.
Many movies use younger, thinner women as "body-doubles" for close-ups of female movie stars.
Body image is how people perceive their own bodies.
Stereotypes of women have also appeared on many television programs in the past.
These kinds of roles can still be seen today, for example, in many of the telenovelas from Latin America.
Many male characters are portrayed as capable, strong, and ready to fight to defend themselves or to protect others.
Perhaps the best example is in Janpanese manga, in which males are usually dominant and females are generally dependent and submissive.
Because gender is one basis for social inequality, that is, privileges and access for some groups but not for others, it is especially important to understand these messages about gender and gender roles.
Today, the Internet is so integrated into our lives and the media that it is hard to imagine a world without it.
This is possible bexause of two important developments in digital technology: the browser and the search engine.
Anyonr can find large amounts of news and information instantly.
Users no longer have to depend on what they a newspaper or television station decides is newsworthy.
They can also find entertainment that is not available on traditional media, such as interactive games.
The telephone directory usually just provides the name, address, and telephone number of a business.
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is created by users.
Although the Internet has brought many advances, the speed and accessibility of the medium also has drawbacks.
The term digital divide refers to unequal access to digital information.
